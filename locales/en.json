Olena Radko, a graduate of the P. I. Tchaikovsky National Music Academy of Ukraine (conducting class - L. M. Venediktov), laureate of international competitions, is the permanent director.",
    "aboutUs2": "The MORAVSKI Chamber Choir is named after the outstanding Ukrainian choral conductor and teacher of the 20-21st century Pavlo Muravskyi (1914-2014). To restore historical justice, the collective named its choir «Moravski», because the real surname of Pavlo Ivanovych is Moravskiy.",

    "aboutOlena": "Olena Radko — main conductor and artistic director of the choir, laureate of international choral competitions, graduate of the National Music Academy of Ukraine named after P. I. Tchaikovsky in 2001. <br /> <br /> Olena was able to unite people from different professions - some participants do not even have a musical education. We have graduates of Taras Shevchenko Kyiv National University, NTUU «Kyiv Polytechnic Institute», candidates of pedagogical, mathematical, chemical sciences, associate professors, teachers, engineers. We also have a nuclear physicist, puppet theater actors, linguists, and even a poet and a folk craftswoman. In addition (and this is very inspiring), professional students from the Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts and the Kyiv Borys Grinchenko University come to the choir."
